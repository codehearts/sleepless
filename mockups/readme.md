## Mockups
Mockups were created before any code was written.

The first draft of the app was intended to make use of offscreen space to display statics without being intrusive.

The homepage was designed to explain what Sleepless is and to provide resources to get the user involved right away, stressing that registration is not necessary. For the purposes of the demo, registration wasn't possible anyway.

The launch page provides basic statistics about the deck and provides controls for the user to personalize their studying experience. It also allows the user to opt in to have their data stored locally so that they can continue where they left off without registering. The revised design allowed for decks to have associate images.

The card listing page was originally designed to use a table format, but was later redesigned to have a more card-like appearance. This also allowed for the reuse of styles.

The study page was intended to be as simple and intuitive as possible. It presents the question and a large button to reveal the answer.

Once the "Show Answer" button is pressed, the user is presented with buttons to evaluate how well they knew the answer. Their response is used to calculate the next time to show them that card.

When the user is done studying, they're presented with the amount of time they spent studying, the number of cards they studied, and the number of cards that will be studied the next day.
