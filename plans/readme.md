## Planning
The first steps I took were to write [guidelines](https://github.com/codehearts/sleepless/raw/master/plans/guidelines.pdf) for the project which detailed the colors, tone, functionality, and implementation details. Then I created an interaction map to detail the navigation hierarchy and structure of the app:

This included developing a data storage layout that would allow the necessary data to be stored in as little space as possible to make the best use of the space provided by local storage.
