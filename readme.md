### Sleepless is a no-nonsense way to study the things that matter to you.
Sleepless was a project I took on one summer to gain experience with Django. It's a simple demo of a notecard studying application, similar to [Anki](http://ankisrs.net), that would allow a user to study notecards and keep track of their progress without even needing an account. This is done by using local storage to keep a user's information stored locally. The entire project was planned out and mockups were created before any code was written.

Technologies used:
- Django
- HTML/Jinja templating
- CSS/Less
- JavaScript/jQuery (the js wound up being a mess as I rushed to finish it before the end of summer)
- Local Storage
