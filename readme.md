## Sleepless is a no-nonsense way to study the things that matter to you.
Sleepless was a project I took on one summer to gain experience with Django. It's a simple demo of a notecard studying application, similar to [Anki](http://ankisrs.net), that would allow a user to study notecards and keep track of their progress without even needing an account. This is done by using local storage to keep a user's information stored locally. The entire project was planned out and mockups were created before any code was written.

Technologies used:
- Django
- HTML/Jinja templating
- CSS/Less
- JavaScript/jQuery (the js wound up being a mess as I rushed to finish it before the end of summer)
- Local Storage

### Online Demo
I've put the demo online at [http://iamnatehart.com/sleepless/demo/](http://iamnatehart.com/sleepless/demo/). It's missing author pages (which weren't really planned) and only seems to let you study if you opt in for data storage. If you clear your local storage after using it you'll be good, and any cookies set will expire when you end your browsing session.
